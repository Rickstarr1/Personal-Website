Only ten students are selected annually from the entire Grainger College of Engineering based on their exceptional academic achievements and transformative leadership.</p>

                        <p>I was humbled to receive this recognition for mentoring underrepresented engineering students through ARISE and SHPE, leading semiconductor research initiatives while maintaining academic excellence, and developing support systems for underclassmen in MEP and IEEE.</p>
                    
                        <p>The Knights of St. Patrick honor reflects my core belief that engineering leadership means advancing both technology and the people who create itâ€”a principle I'll continue applying throughout my career in nanoscale device development.</p>
